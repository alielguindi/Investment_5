# Investment_5

Comparing two approaches to building risk-models: the known- factors/unknown exposure of Fama-French approach and the unknown factors/known ex- posure of Fama-MacBeth. For that we will construct the return to a momentum trading strategy and then analyze its exposure to market and industry factors, using the two different approaches. To this end, we will use data on the 500 stocks that are part of the S&P500 index, their standard industry classification (SIC) codes, and the returns to 12 value-weighted industry portfolios. 

NB : Raw data can't be provided. However, someone with WRDS access could download the same raw datafile as mine
